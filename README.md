# Pic-a-Pis
Author Allan Mugweru

This project is a website whose function is to showcase a Pic-a-Pis restaurant's type of pizzas and they offer and delivery terms.

The website is operational and all its functionalities are working well. These are such as choosing diffenrt sizes,crusts, toppings and number of orders and geting the total price. You can also choose delivery services at a fee and get the notification.

For installation Use git, Github and any editor or IDE to see the codes and the rendered frontend.

Creation of this project I used HTMl for markup, CSS and bootstrap for styling the page and javascript and Jquery for functionality.
